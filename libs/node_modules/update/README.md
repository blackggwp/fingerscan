# update [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/update.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/update)

> Update the year in all files in a project using glob patterns.

Currently this only updates the year in a project, but the goal is to add other features for keeping a project up to date.

Also, the regex used for updating the year in copyright statements is pretty opinionated at the moment, but I'm open to making this more flexible if someone wants to do a PR.

npm i -g update
```
